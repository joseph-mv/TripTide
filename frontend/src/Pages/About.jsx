            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              The idea for TripTide was born from countless road trips and a
              desire to make travel planning easier and more enjoyable.
              Frustrated with the lack of comprehensive tools for planning
              routes and discovering hidden gems along the way, we set out to
              create a platform that would change the way people travel.
